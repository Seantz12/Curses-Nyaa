# Curses-Nyaa
Searches Nyaa for torrents and hopefully will allow you to download them using your torrent client of choice!


Features that work:

Can search for torrents (No longer works on uriwd version, need to find way to take inputs)

Can view seeders and leechers as well as category (Anime, literature, etc.)

Can filter through trusted only vs everything, can sort by asec or desc and 
seeders/leechers/date/etc.

Displays everything in a curses interface

Seamlessly navigate between multiple pages on Nyaa (no clicking next page!)


Features that don't work (need fixing):

FIX TAHT UGLY INTERFACE GOD PLEASE

main_screen.py line 34-36, change temp to perm fix


Planned features:

Ability to download magnet link directly from console and start torrent

Ability to actually change settings (yeah... kind of didn't do that yet lol)

Make it actually look nice, will provide image of design at some point (URWID looks WAY better)


Possible Features:

Automatic downloading/notifying you of new torrents for anime you've selected

Sync between this and MAL account or other similar accounts

Possibly even include other torrent sites


Yeah, this is my little side project that I'm working on during university, This program is designed
for those who hate overly extravagent interfaces and prefer lightweight clients. And especially to those
who prefer using terminal for anything and everything they possibly can, including downloading anime and manga.
