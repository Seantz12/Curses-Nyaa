# Curses-Nyaa
Searches Nyaa for torrents and hopefully will allow you to download them using your torrent client of choice!

Features that work:
Can search for torrents
Can view seeders and leechers as well as category (Anime, literature, etc.)
Can filter through trusted only vs everything, can sort by asec or desc and seeders/leechers/date/etc.
Displays everything in a curses interface

Features that don't work (need fixing):
Interface is still a little buggy, some issues with displaying torrents

Planned features:
Ability to go to second page and beyond (pretty easy to implement)
Ability to download magnet link directly from console and start torrent
Ability to actually change settings (yeah... kind of didn't do that yet lol)
Make it actually look nice, will provide image of design at some point

Possible Features:
Automatic downloading/notifying you of new torrents for anime you've selected
Sync between this and MAL account or other similar accounts
Possibly even include other torrent sites

Yeah, this is my little side project that I'm working on during university, This program is designed
for those who hate overly extravagent interfaces and prefer lightweight clients. And especially to those
who prefer using terminal for anything and everything they possibly can, including downloading anime and manga.
